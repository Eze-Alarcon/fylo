## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I created this project with the intention of putting into practice the skills I was acquiring at the time. It is not a very exhausting project, but it did force me to correctly implement a design system.

This project helped me to see the practicality of having concrete design systems and maintaining them throughout the project.

### Continued development

One thing I wish I had known back then was the importance of separating styles correctly, in the end I ended up with a big mess of styles between media queries, inconsistently named classes and some other opportunities for improvement.

This helped me that, nowadays, my projects have a better consistency not only using a design system but also thinking deeply about class and variable names.
